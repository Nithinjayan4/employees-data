## 1. Project Overview

This repository contains a **data-handling / employee-management** project built using **JavaScript** and **TypeScript** (with CSS for styling).  
It allows you to perform operations such as creating, listing, and managing employee data.

This project serves as a **practical learning exercise** to improve JavaScript and TypeScript skills by building a full-stack (client + server) or client-side application for managing employee records.

## 2. Folder / File Structure

Below is a summary of the main folders and files included in the repository:

- **`server/`** â€“ Contains backend (or mock server) code for handling employee data.  
- **`client/`** â€“ Contains frontend code (UI, JavaScript/TypeScript, CSS) for interacting with the data.  
- **Other files** â€“ Configuration, `README.md`, and `package.json` files for project setup.

> **Note:**  
> The repository includes two main folders (`server`, `client`).  
> GitHub language breakdown:  
> - TypeScript â‰ˆ 66%  
> - JavaScript â‰ˆ 30%  
> - CSS â‰ˆ 3.8%

## 3. Challenges / Tasks Completed

- Built a **client-side interface** for managing employee records (add, list, possibly edit/delete).  
- Created a **server component** to handle employee data, potentially via REST API or mock server.  
- Implemented **client-server integration** for fetching and submitting data.  
- Used **TypeScript** for stronger typing and maintainable code structure.  
- Styled the interface using **CSS** to make it visually appealing.  
- Organized the project with a **modular folder structure** for clarity.  
- Demonstrated a complete **end-to-end data flow** from backend to frontend.  
- Used **Git & GitHub** for version control and open-source collaboration.

## 4. Technologies & Tools Used

- **TypeScript** â€“ Main language used (~66%) for type safety.  
- **JavaScript** â€“ Used alongside TypeScript (~30%) for logic implementation.  
- **CSS** â€“ Styling and UI design.  
- **Node.js** â€“ Backend runtime environment.  
- **Git & GitHub** â€“ Version control and repository hosting.  
- *(Optional: React, Express, etc., if included in `package.json`)*
